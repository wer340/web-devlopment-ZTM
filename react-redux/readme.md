## run first app
for create react app better way  \
`npx create-react-app my-app`\
whats npx ? \
back in day what we would do is say   install `npm install-g create-react-app`  if install globally \
but doing an npm install `-g` is a little messy and also you have that thing where you have to run sudo if  you don't have enough access`sudo npm install-g create-react-app` \
since 5.2 npm actually comes out of the box for you \
write command `npx install create-react-app robo-friend`\
 react, react-dom, and react-scripts is downloading..\

now  we have `package-lock.json`  and this is automatically generated by the package that json file and it make sure that the versions that im using right now of our dependencies every single that you see in node modules  it locks the version numbers so that if i sent this project to your across the sea across the world you open this file or this group of file  its going to work the exact same way because these version numbers are locked \
`.gitignore`  into file leave  ` /node_modules /.pnp  /.pnp.js` \

## 12
and reason they are  separated into two (`react`,`react-dom`) because **react can be used with anything** it doesn't have to be just for apps on the browser it can be for mobile thats why react native is for it could be for VR an virtual reality\
so based on where you using react you need a package to essentially two packages for the main react library

and use `<React.StrictMode >` just give us extra protection that again , we don't need to worry about /
and use  `import React ,{component} from 'react'` then use `class App extends component`  ;
## 15  classes vs hooks       cover both way

## 17 component
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
```
App is component ,for creating component like this and notice  if  you write multi line use  `return (<div> <h1>hi</h1> <h1>scarlett</h1></div>)`\
```jsx 
import React ,{Component} from "react";

class Hello extends Component{
    render(){
        return <h1>hello this is test for learning react dev</h1>
    }
}
export default Hello;
``` 
and   use `npm install tachyons `  for  ready class css similar to bootstrap  and read doc [tachyons](https://tachyons.io/docs/) notice just only have `import 'tachyons' ` in `index.js` no need to have every component\
why use `<div className="">`  ?\
java script use class for  class  and make sense this keyword  like this  ! \
and we use props  that can be called anything \
into `index.js` write`<Hello greething={"hello "+ " scarlett"} />`\
and into `hello.js` write `return (<h4 className= "tc f1">{this.props.greething} ❤</h4> </div>)`
and rather than class use const function \
```jsx 
class App extends  Component{
render(){
 return (<div><h1 className= "f-headline  tc">hello this is test</h1><h4 className= "tc f1">{props.greething} ❤</h4> </div>)
}
}
//use this rather than
const Hello =(props)=>{
        return (<div><h1 className= "f-headline  tc">hello this is test</h1><h4 className= "tc f1">{props.greething} ❤</h4> </div>)
}
```
## 18
notice   your component file `app.js` `hello.js` with language mode babel > javascript or `app.jsx` and`hello.jsx` \
and must be asking yourself why are we using `react` here? i m not using this~!\
```js
import React from `react`
const Hello =(props)=>{
        return (<div><h1 className= "f-headline  tc">hello this is test</h1><h4 className= "tc f1">{props.greething} ❤</h4> </div>)
}

```
if comment `react` lib  you  look error   because  react  handle  jsx ,  jsx is this portion is not relate to js lang  `<div ></div> ` \

## [robo hash  use aas  image good api ](https://robohash.org/) \
use  robo hash   `src="https://robohash.org/random_name?200×200"`\

in this structure when use  `export const list=[{}]`   then for  call use import {list} from `./list.js`  because we not use default as for this پ
and  you  use  `const card=({email,id,name})` rather than `const card=(props)` \
or  
```js
const Hello =(props)=>{//(props) ~ ({greething})
  const {greething}=props
        return (<div><h1 className= "f-headline  tc">hello this is test</h1><h4 className= "tc f1">{ greething} ❤</h4> </div>)

This code results in an error: Adjacent JSX elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag.
The solutions
One option is to wrap the elements with a parent element.\

## 21 loop   and     atom convert molecule   like card to cardlist
we use map  for iterate a list of content then if i open up the console here  i will see that i get a warning each child in an array \
`warning : each child in an array or iterator should have a unique "key" prop` \
when working with react the way the virtual dom works is it keep track of  what all those card are but without having something called a `key prop `  if some of these card get deleted react wont know which ones which and we will have to change the entire dom versus if you had a key prop and says oh this one gets removed i  can just remove this from the dom remember we want to minimize the amount of work that we do to the dump 
```js
// state >> props
constructor(){
  super()
  list:list, //not use {list}  this is pure js  not html that handle by babel
  searchfield:''
}
//use setState({})  for update state 
this.setState({searchfield:event.target.value})
// App is parent component and use this for communicate  with two child 
// first use onChange attribute  till run function  ,the function passed to search component by props   and make function with App.property  onSearchChange =(e)={e.target.value}  
```
props  its deterministic , pure function  and its something that we have talked about before  these component are whats called pure component and some even call it dumb component it just mean that they don't really  need to know about anything other than the fact that they are pure function that receive something and return something \
props never change  props are always just inputs that we get and we have never modified them  but this search case we need a memory in our app\
**and thats what state is in react state** simply mean the description of your app **state** is simply an object , an object that describe your application. and this state which describes our application is the robots and whatever is entered in the search box. and state is able to change , we are able to change the value of the search box , the value of the input  and we are able to change what robots our  means whats gets displayed  \
**props** are simply things that come out of state \
so a parent feeds state into a child component and as soon as the child component ,component receive  a state  its a property that child can never change that property\
the parent just tells it what the state is and the child receives it as robots \
and they usually live in the parent component the component that is the parent that just kind of passes state to different components npm

## 25  lifecycle method  react
in more realistic app  not exist manual ready list of name address ,..   and we have to fetch list with API \
two site can use API for exercise  [typicode](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)  and [cypress](https://jsonplaceholder.cypress.io/)  \
react have  **life-cycle hooks** , what they do is if we run these , it will automatically  trigger when this app gets loaded on the website \
we have 3 session1️⃣Mounting  2️⃣Updating 3️⃣Unmounting \

### [Mounting](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html)
1️⃣constructor()\
2️⃣static getDerivedStateFromProps()\
3️⃣render()\
4️⃣componentDidMount()\
when see app or refresh react check   whether these method exist  in code or no?\
### Updating
it also has something called updating , and that is whenever  a component changes \
1️⃣static getDerivedStateFromProps()\
2️⃣shouldComponentUpdate()\
3️⃣render()\
4️⃣getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()\
5️⃣componentDidUpdate()\
### 3️Unmounting 
And finally , with and unmounting is when a component is removed from a page , for example , if we change  \
**these are called lifecycle hooks** becaus they get run every time a component does something and it comes with react  so you can just put them in into your class component and they will automatically get triggered \
componentDidMount() use this for fetch APi\
```js
componentDidMount(){
  fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users') //windows.fetch
  .then(response =>{ response.json()})
  .then(user =>{ this.setstate({list:user}) }) 
}

```
Note that despite the method being named json(), the result is not JSON but is instead the result of taking JSON as input and parsing it to produce a JavaScript object\

## 26  props.children
we want to scrollable our view robots app \
```js
<Scrollable>
<Cardlist>
</Scrollable>

```
Scrollable component is not a self closing tag that wrap a component, how can fetch cardlist as argument in  Scrollable component  with **children** \
```js
const Scrollable=(props)=>{
  console.log(props)
return (
  //two {{}} first bracket for java script expression second  for  css object 
<div style={{overflowY:'scroll',border:'5px solid pink',height:'800px'}}>{props.children}</div>

)
}
export default Scrollable;

```
react trickle down all this information as props to all these components and magically create our view for us

## 27  management  workspace   for find bug
make two folder  with  containers name and components /
pure or dumb components leave into components folder  and smart components (have class  have life cycle method) leave into containers folder  css file put aside index.js  but  font file ,.. leave into components /

```js
if(!this.state.list.length===0){
  return(<h1 className="tc green pa3">loading</h1>)
}else{

  return(
     <div className="tc"> 
         <SearchBox  searchText={this.onSearchChange} />
         <Scrollable>
         <Cardlist list={filterRobo} />
         </Scrollable>

     </div>
 )
}
        
// can be cleaner  with this
return !this.state.list.length?
                (<h1 className="tc green pa3">loading</h1>)
        :

             (
                <div className="tc"> 
                    <SearchBox  searchText={this.onSearchChange} />
                    <Scrollable>
                    <Cardlist list={filterRobo} />
                    </Scrollable>
    
                </div>
            )

// and use   

this.state.list.filter(item=>{//statement})
//rather than
const {searchfield,list}=this.state;
list.filter(item=>{//statement})
```
## 29 vulnerabilities (8 high, 1 critical)
when clone repo from [github](https://github.com/aneagoie/robofriends/blob/master/package.json)   possibility this repo have vulnerabilities  for resolve this issue use  ` npm audit fix`  for this \
some  vulnerabilities  must be review as manually because can be break your app after update lib  \
use `npm audit `  give  you idea for resolve finally can be used `npm audit fix --force` \
and `package.json ` have minor  and major update   \
use `npm update` for perform update package
```json

[react 16 -> 17 ](https://reactjs.org/blog/2020/08/10/react-v17-rc.html)

## 33   react 16  was a new version of React introduced something called **error boundaries** 
it solved the problem that reactor had previously which was if there was some sort of an air within a component , for whatever reason , there wasn't a graceful way to handle it   on the next render , you'd  get all these cryptic errors and things just wouldn't work out nicely  \
And for a user , you want to make sure that even if a part of your component break , you can still have nice UI experience  a maybe a piece of text says something went wrong but not have the app break  \
```js
class ErrorBoundary extends Component{
    constructor(props){ // props trickle down 
        super(props)
    this.state={
        hasError:false
    }
    }
    componentDidCatch(error,info){ //from react 16 to later
        this.setState({
            hasError:true
        })

    }
    render(){
        if(this.state.hasError){
            return(<h1>ooooops happen error</h1>)
        }else{
            return(this.props.children)
        }
    }
}
// then 
<ErrorBoundary>
<Cardlist>//children
</ErrorBoundary>

## 34 deploy   github pages
many [solution](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/) for deploy app\
1️⃣Open your package.json and add a homepage field for your project:`  "homepage": "https://myusername.github.io/my-app",` \

2️⃣Install gh-pages and add deploy to scripts in `package.json` ,`npm install --save gh-pages`\
and Add the following scripts in your `package.json`:
```json
  "scripts": {
   "predeploy": "npm run build",//+
   "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",//+
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build"}
```
  3️⃣ `npm run deploy`
  4️⃣ For a project page, ensure your project’s settings use gh-pagesm 

  ## 35 keep up to date    react v.16 come up hooks 

  ## 36 [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#:~:text=Hooks%20are%20a%20new%20addition,features%20without%20writing%20a%20class.&text=This%20new%20function%20useState%20is,doesn't%20make%20sense%20yet!) 

    if w ehad some logic of lets say changing sate in our class components sometimes if we want to do something similar in another component its a little harder to do with the way that we had it before **Hooks** makes this a little bit easier\
    Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data)\
    big motivation for use hooks Classes confuse both people and machines\
    hooks allow us to not use class , not use the this keyword in our react applications another major reason that is overlook is the react wants to do something called **ahead of time compilation one day**  , hopefully for performance , something that thing like `svelte,Angular , Glimmer` do 


## 37   robofriend app convert from class to hook 
1️⃣ git clone ... 2️⃣npm update 3️⃣ npm audit fix \
notice hooks came up from react v.16.8  to later\
 
## 38   hooks
hooks are function that let you  hook into  react state and lifecycle feature from function components.\
hooks dont work inside classes\
☕for use hook\
`import React,{ useState,useEffect} from react`\

## 39
hook is a special function that lets you hook into react feature so that you useState and they useEfact hook allow to hook into a react a feature because its from the react library to either work  with state or with life-cycle method\
```js
function App(){
  //comment life-cycle method constructor  componentDidMount render
  // convert onSearchCahange=(event){} to const onSearchCahange=(event){}
  const onSearchCahange=(event){}
}
```
## 40  replicate    constructor
```js
// these two line  put  rather than constructor() method
const [List,setList]=useState([]) ; // inside parentheses  put initiate value
const [SearchField,setSearchField]=useState('') ;

const onSearchChange=(event){
  setSearchField(event.target.value)
}
```

## 41  useEffect
useEffect gets run every time the function app gets run automatically\
this method run function in the infinite loop and this is another tricky part of when people get started with hooks again use second parameter also\
first parameter render function second one is dependency \
useEffect receives an array as a second argument \
## why exactly the useEffect was running continuosly over and over and over\
 well if we look at the below code when th app render it create the state then it run the useEffect because it render so it fetch the users an then these users are going to update the state its going to update their robot state with new user so what happen ,well new users are being rendered right here  so the app re renders and says hey i got new robots , so i need to render myself to show the robots so it renders but remember what i said with use hooks every time the component renders its going to run useEffect so its going to run fetch again and then its going to set robots again then its going to setRobots again so it has to render and then it goes useEffect again so it goes into a continuos loop.
## trick for useEffect
give second parameter  and this optional list tell us in here hey when should i run useEffect so you can tell react to  skip applying the effect or the useEffect function if certain value haven't changed rerenders **so in here we say hey only one useEffect if one of these have changed**  when put in [] similar to componentDidMount() 

```js
function App () {

  const[robots,setRobots]=useState([]);
  useEffect(()=>{
    fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.cypress.io/users').then(results=>results.json()).then(users=> setRobots(users))
  }
    , []])
  return(<h1>{robot[1].name}</h1>)
}
```
## 45 redux and webpack

## 46 before talk about redux need to talk about state management
the state described what our app should look like \
i want you to think of state as **memory**  an app needs to remember things in order to work otherwise , we would just have simple email webpage like before \
state like robo-friend s app but sate management is a really hard problem as our apps get bigger and bigger and bigger    and keeping track of all this state is really really hard\
 so we need some form of a state management and **redux** solve this problem for us what if we just remove all the state , so this state from  all the components ? \
 what if we just have props?\
 so all these components just have props being passed down and now the state , we keep it in a store. and a store is simply just **the state** but in one massive object\
 so one single object that describe how our app should look and  all we do is just pass down that state to whichever component needs it as props.\
 ### redux is a library that makes state management easier , not only for react , but for any tools that we use 
 **redux actually inspiration data base design** from such as event sourcing or cq press , which you can read up more on database had same problem all these update and all these change happened but we needed a way to make sure that all these changes are organized in a nice\

 ## 47 why do you use redux?
 1️⃣ good for managing large state\
 2️⃣useful for sharing data between containers\
 3️⃣predictable state management using the 3 principles\

 redux has predictable state management using the three principles now what are the three \

 ## the 3 principles
 1️⃣single source of truth ☕  big object\
 2️⃣state is read only ☕ never get modified and instead we would create a new state after each action is taken by the user\
 3️⃣changes using pure functions ☕ that changes are made only using pure function ▶[pure function that receive an input and always return aan output that is predictable]\

 action ▶ reducer[pure function]  ▶ store make changes\
 redux i want to teach this just for historical purposes uses an architectural pattern called **flux pattern architecture** and software is used as a way to make sure that we are able  to solve problems in a logical sense and in an organized fashion 
 ## flux pattern ✅  Action ▶ Dispatcher ▶ store ▶ view
 because before that idea  we had something called MVC[model view controller] and you may have heard \
 now problem with mvc pattern is well this diagram over here we have the controller that changes different pieces of the model and this model can changes the view that can trigger a another  change and that model can change another part of the view and so on and so for and we have this thing that we saw before we have the craziness of actions and making changes all thee arrows just crisscrossing and not looking very nice  and although it might not be bad when your apps are smaller as your apps get bigger you want to do something like flux pattern\
 ```js
 redux===this.state;
 ```

## 48 redux implement 
`npm install redux`  \
this redux package will give us some tolls in order to incorporate redux into our react app also redux it still improving your javaScript skills when you write redux.\
the second thing we need and this something similar with react , remember how we installed the react package and then we also needed something called **the react DOM**package to react to the dom well , in similar fashion , we need to connect redux to react , because redux theoretically could work with any other library by adding another package we  can again let know that hey  we are going to be using redux with you \
`npm install react-redux ` \
the way this react-redux is going to work is that its going to connect only the container \

## 49 [redux toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started)
you will notice one thing thats a little painful that some people dont like about redux. and that is the idea that redux has a lot of boilerplate code .\
yoh have to learn new pattern you have to create numerous file to accomplish something that would have been really easy to do in just react .
now the added benefit is that it makes our code more maintainable , more scalable as our apps grow .but it does mean more typing by developer . more files , more boilerplate and boilerplate simply mean code that you write over and over\
and you see when we start building things like ***actions reducer** , how you are repetitive code . and redux toolkit was created for this reason its the batteries-included toolset for efficient redux development they take a lot of the manual hard work with redux and generates a lot of really niceties for us
for handle boilerplate and type many line code 

## 50  write code   so use redux concept
the first thing we want to do is create something called an **action** and also a **reducer** remember diagram  ☕ Action ▶ Reducer ▶ Store ▶ Make Change \
redux has these two components  an action and a reducer so we are going to build those to out \
create new file in `src` folder  by `action.js` name \
within here we are going to create an action using just plain old javascript we are going to say export 
```js
import {CHANGE_SEARCH_FIELD} from './constants.js'
export const setSearchField=(text) =>({
  type:'CHANGE_SEARCH_FIELD',// capitalize because this variable is constant
  payload:text

})//because we want to keep this as small as possible we can actually wrap it in url brackets so that we can avoid the return statement , we are just returning an object and this object is going to have a type 
```
 and  then create new file in `src` folder  by `constants.js` name\

 ```js
 export const CHANGE_SEARCH_FIELD='CHANGE_SEARCH_FIELD'
 ```
 and need to create `reducer.js`  in `src` folder    that spit out all action to its\

```js
import {CHANGE_SEARCH_FIELD} from './constants.js'
const initialState ={
  searchField:''

}
export const searchRobots=(state=initialState,action={})=>{
  switch(action.type){

const mapStateToProps=state=>{
  return{
    searchField:state.searchField
  }
}
const mapDispatchToProps=(dispatch)=>{
 return {onSearhChange:(event)=> dispatch(setSearchField(event.target.value))} 
}

export default connect(mapStateToProps,mapDispatchToProps)(App);//high order function
```
